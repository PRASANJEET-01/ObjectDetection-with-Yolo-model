# ObjectDetection-with-Yolo-model
The real time Object Detection with Yolo model and Open-cv and python
YOLO (You Only Look Once) real-time object detection algorithm, which is one of the most effective object detection algorithms that also encompasses many of the most innovative ideas coming out of the computer vision research community.
Object detection is a critical capability of autonomous vehicle technology.
It’s an area of computer vision that’s exploding and working so much better than just a few years ago. At the end of this article, we’ll see a couple of recent updates to YOLO by the original researchers of this important technique.
    YOLO is extremely fast
    YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance.
    YOLO learns generalizable representations of objects so that when trained on natural images and tested on artwork, the algorithm outperforms other top detection methods.
